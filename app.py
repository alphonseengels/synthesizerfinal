'''
Implement high pass, low pass, and band pass filter using
a fast fourier transform (FFT)
this is possibly built into numpy
'''


'''
figure out *how* a LFO modulates things like pitch,
filter, etc...
'''

'''
allow the play function to play multiple oscillators at the same time...

how?
way 1: somehow add oscillators together and pass the addition to the function? 
way 2: pass multiple oscillators to the function?
