Project Overview:
This is a simple digital synthesizer. You can chose between one, two, or three oscillators of three different wave types: sine, square, and saw. You can adjust the volume with the built-in slider, and you can see the generated waveform in the IDE.

Installation and Setup Instructions:
Run GUI.py. 

Usage Guide: 
The GUI window will pop up. To get started, you can press any of the notes (C, C#, D, etc.) to hear a sine wave of the frequency
listed. You may change the oscillators by choosing the wave type in the drop-down menus provided. Oscillators 2 and 3 will not be active
until you select a wave type. Click the note buttons to hear the changes you make, and look in the IDE to see the graphs of waveforms you 
generate!

Testing Procedures:
Try pressing the note buttons without changing any of the menus. Go through the wave menus and change them as you see fit to create different combinations. Try adjusting the volume.
